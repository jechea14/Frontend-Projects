## My process

- Structure HTML with classes
- Start with mobile-first design then to desktop design
- Google any problems with things not working as intended

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- More practice on responsive design and flexbox
- I was not able to center the body using flexbox using

```css
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
```

so I googled and found on stackoverflow to include this:

```css
min-height: 100vh;
```

it worked.

- I also experimented with unit measurements of em, rem, and px.

### Continued development

Will be redoing this project with SCSS/SASS then maybe the advanced frameworks/libraries
